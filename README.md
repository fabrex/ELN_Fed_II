# ELN_Fed_II
Python introduction for all the students of Elaborazione del Linguaggio Naturale of University of Napoli Federico II

Hi there!

Welcome to the first Python class ever (?) (actually, not so pretty sure of it) of the Federico II ELN course.

Python will be your new best buddy, so please take care of it night and day. 
Rememeber to feed it with all your love, patience and homework (I'm joking, dudes! Come on!!)

Enjoy the class and have fun!
